Excel formulas that I was proud of

DATA CLEANSING AND ANALYZING
when your cleaning data, you assign the data types, then check for nulls, then check for duplicates.
Then you create calculated columns.
Then you format the report.
Then you try to automate the original report.


Reports Generation
Conditional formatting and referencing for readability. Use the company colors to get clients familiarized with your work.
   Create a notes tab for documentation.
   Don't let their terminology distract you. You'll be surprised the shit they make up to replace simpler words.
Get comfortable looking at columns and the data. Make assumptions and define columns.
  Verify what the columns mean. Define what the columns are and verify with the report giver or colleagues.
  Verify if any columns were calculated. Learn a few functions to handle calculations and string values.
