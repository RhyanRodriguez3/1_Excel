VBA is a tool for programming, editing and running application code. You can create a custom function with VBA. 

## Object Oriented Programming Languages
- In each statement start by defining the object. Think of a cell as the object you want to change.
- The basic of OOP Objects are data structures that contain data about an object as well in the form of properties and also code in the form of methods.

## Turning on the Developer Tab
- Go to the file tab, click options, click customize ribbons, check the developer box.
- Use Record Macro, title the macro name and fill descriptions, then save in your personal macro workbook to use on any file or save on 'this workbook' to keep it only in that file.
> TIP: Use 'ctrl + shift + YourKey' as a general formula for saving shortcuts. There are not a lot of shortcuts using this combo.
- Use ctrl + enter to execute each macro step. Then stop recording.
- Each macro defaults to absolute references. 'Use relative reference' button to create a macro that doesn't depend on an absolute reference. Absolute referencing is good for sorting and filtering. Always consider wether you want to use relative reference of not. 

## Simple Macros
- Create a few simple macros, like convert a column that was inputted into ecxcel into the correct format. In this case, record the macro and do what you normally would and it will save it for you.
- Get comforatble writing down every step of the macro.
